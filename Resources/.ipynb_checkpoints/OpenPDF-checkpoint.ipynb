(GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaQ3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobilesearch, YouTube, and Cloud. We celebrated Google's 21st birthday this quarter. While ourmission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and usefulhasn't changed, we've evolved from a company that helps people find answers to acompany that helps you get things done.Since the beginning, we've always invested in tackling deep computer science problemsthat can have a significant impact on society. The chance to be part of these fundamentalengineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google. In just the lastweek we have announced two significant advances. First, powered by our long-terminvestment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people askGoogle Search. It's the biggest leap forward for search in the past five years. It’s allpossible because of a new type of neural network-based technique for natural languageprocessing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in language and provides morerelevant results.Second, we recently announced a major quantum computing milestone. I wasextraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To demonstrate supremacy,Google's 53-qubit quantum machine Sycamore, successfully performed a testcomputation in just 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful supercomputersmuch longer time to accomplish. It's the Hello, World! moment we’ve been waiting for andrepresents a distinct milestone in our effort to harness the principles of quantummechanics, to solve computational problems.Turning from quantum to the quarter. Today, I'll talk about the momentum we saw acrossthe business in the last three months. First, Cloud. We saw customer momentum acrossmultiple areas under Thomas’ leadership. In September, we announced a landmarkpartnership with Mayo Clinic. Using Google Cloud to secure and store data andunderstand insights at scale, Mayo Clinic will partner with us in many ways. Together, we'llwork to transform patient and clinician experiences, identify new methods of diagnosingdiseases, conduct clinical research, and find new models for delivering patient care.National Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi-cloud strategy to help thecompany better use data and deliver new and improved customer experiences. DeutscheBörse Group, the fourth largest stock exchange group worldwide relies on Google Cloudto help them navigate the twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations andaddressing significant regulatory requirements.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single3/21\\x0c12/11/2019Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaRetailers are also turning to cloud solutions to help make the shopping experience asseamless and personalized as possible. For example, Macy's uses Google Cloud tostreamline their operations from the distribution center to the shop floor.Public sector customers are modernizing their IT systems with Google Cloud with greatresults. For example, the state of Arizona already has more than 36,000 employees usingour products to increase productivity, efficiency and security. And this quarter, it furtherextended our relationship.We continue to extend our cloud services through partners, including a new solution thatenables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the first time. We announced thecloud region in Nevada. When it launches in 2020, it will be our 7th cloud region in theU.S. We also announced a new cloud region in Poland, our 7th in Europe.Turning to Google's product that people use every day. We're excited about new featureslunched in maps, including detailed voice guidance while walking that will make it possiblefor people who have vision impairments or are blind, get around more easily. New tool thatwill allow users to see all of their flight and hotel reservations in one place. And anothernew feature that gives transit riders in 30 countries the ability to see ridesharing and bikingoptions near their bus or train stop.In Search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find keymoments in videos, easily find products within images via Google Lens, and discover newpodcast.Our hardware business is still in its early stages, but we’re continuing to build the businessand a portfolio of helpful products. Two weeks ago, we unveiled our new Made by Googleproduct lineup, bringing together the best of hardware, software, and AI.Our new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the first phones with motion sense. This allows usersto use natural gestures to get things done without touching their phone. The new GoogleAssistant now gives users the ability to switch seamlessly between apps, all by voice. Andthe new Pixelbook Go provides many of the great features of our premium Pixelbook at amore affordable price point. We also unveiled a new, more powerful Nest Mini speakerand Nest WiFi. Finally, the team is looking forward to launching Pixel Buds, first trulywireless headphones, as well Stadia, our streaming gaming platform, which will soon beavailable in the U.S., UK, Canada and throughout Europe.We are encouraged by the positive product reviews so far. With the holidays coming up, Ithink that's a gift for everyone on your list.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single4/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019On to YouTube. Keeping YouTube safe for our users, creatives and partners, whilepreserving the openness of our platform is our top priority. This quarter, we continued toupdate our community guidelines and enforcement to protect users from harmful contentand will keep doing this work. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium continue to expandglobally and are now available in 71 countries. In September, YouTube launched its newfashion and beauty destination called YouTube/Fashion. It's designed to meet the growingdemand from consumers for better ways to explore and connect with some of YouTube'sbiggest fashion and beauty creatives.And I want to emphasize that as we build all these helpful products, we are committed togiving users more control of their data. This quarter, we extended one of our most popularfeatures in Chrome and YouTube, called Incognito Mode to Maps. We expanded our auto-delete controls to YouTube history. These controls already enable people to set theirlocation history and web and app activity to be deleted automatically after 3 or 18 months.And to protect everyone’s safety online, we introduced Password Checkup. It's a newfeature that tells users if any of their passwords are weak, if they've been reused acrossmultiple sites, or if they've been compromised somewhere on the web.Now, moving on to how we are helping advertisers. We are bringing our strengths inmachine learning to help advertisers build their ad campaigns. Machine learning powertools like search auto bidding are gaining traction. In fact, more than half of advertisers’search spend is now optimized via full auto bidding. We now have more than 1 millionadvertisers using responsive search apps, and ad format, we launched a year ago thatuses machine learning to create the right ad for each search queries. And our new VideoReach campaigns allow marketers to upload multiple video ads into a single campaign.From there, we use machine learning to serve the most efficient combination of these adsto help brands reach audiences at scale.This quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular App Campaigns to include newservices, including YouTube search, display video ads and the Discover feed. We alsolaunched YouTube masthead ads for TV, which enable advertisers to reach audiencesright when they open the YouTube app on their connected TVs, one of its fastest-growingscreens.It's also important for advertisers to have standardized measurement that’s fair across allmedia and that delivers insights in a way that fully protects user’s privacy. We are makingit easier for businesses to do just that. Our next generation of Google Analytics unifiesweb and app measurement reporting for the first time to help businesses understandwhich channel is driving the best result.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single5/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019On a personal note, I was in Dallas in October, there I saw firsthand how important Googleis in helping small and medium-sized businesses grow. I got to visit Peacock Alley abedding and bath manufacturer in Dallas with 75 employees. They’ve been using Googleads for over 15 years to help drive traffic to their stores. Their ecommerce has grown 52%in the past year. They credit the guidance Google Analytics provides as well as GoogleShopping and Product Listing Ads for that growth.This isn't the only way we help small businesses grow and thrive. Our Grow with Googleprogram has helped train 3 million Americans in digital skills, including small businessowners and entrepreneurs. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that our IT professionalsupport certificate training course will expand to 100 community colleges. It's alreadyhelped tens of thousands of people pursue fast-growing, well-paying careers in IT support.I’m glad to see more community colleges offer this pathway to students.Finally, to round out a busy quarter. Sustainability has always been a core value for us.And I'm proud that we have been carbon neutral since 2007. In September, we announcedthe biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history. We are increasingGoogle’s existing renewable energy portfolio by more than 40%. These purchases arehappening globally, spurring the construction of more than $2 billion in new energyinfrastructure including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across threecontinents.And at our hardware event, we announced that we're committing to roughly $150 million inrenewable energy projects in key manufacturing regions. Our hope is that this will spureven greater investments in sustainability.So, it's been a really great quarter. A personal highlight for me was our Take Our Parentsto Work Day, which we held in September at our main campus in Mountain View. It wasgreat to see thousands of parents take such pride in what their kids are building. I feel thesame way. None of our work would be possible without our Googlers around the world.This quarter was another great example of the mission that brings us all together. Thankyou.Now, I’ll turn it over to Ruth.Ruth PoratThank you, Sundar.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single6/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019In the third quarter, total revenues of $40.5 billion were up 20% year-on-year and up 22%in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobilesearch, YouTube and Cloud.I will begin with the review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing onyear-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by other Bets andconclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.Details of Alphabet’s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in ourearnings press release.Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues,including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor again thisquarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations includingdepreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly forour advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses,YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of theirrevenues. This line also includes the impact of hardware costs, primarily associated withour mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, with headcount growth being the largest driver ofyear-on-year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, which is reflected in bothcompensation and facilities expenses.With respect to R&D, the growth was again driven by the addition of engineering talent,consistent with our focus on product innovation. The increase in G&A year-over-year wasprimarily due to a $554 million charged from our previously announced legal settlementsin France.Stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Headcount was up 6,450 from the secondquarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers andproduct managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases wereagain in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $9.2 billion, up6% year-over-year for an operating margin up 23%.Other income and expense was a loss of $549 million, which primarily reflects the impactof unrealized losses and marketable equity securities. As of September 30, the unrealizedequity gain in the combined portfolio of marketable and nonmarketable securities was $5.8https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single7/21\\x0c12/11/2019billion. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.Net income was $7.1 billion and earnings per diluted share were $10.12.Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaTurning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.7billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $15.5billion with free cash flow of $8.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketablesecurities of approximately $121 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment.Revenues were $40.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail,Google Sites revenues were $28.6 billion in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year. In termsof dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution fromYouTube followed by desktop search.Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect theperformance as a primary drivers of growth within network, namely, Google Ad managerfollowed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $6.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year,once again fueled by Cloud, followed by a strong performance from Play. Within Cloudgrowth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customerdemand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth inG Suite, reflecting both new pricing and seat growth.Within Play, performance was driven once again by growth in the number of active buyers.In addition, the line reflects hardware, which continued to benefit from the launch of ourPixel 3a mid-tier smartphones.We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of theprice and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costswere $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year. TotalTAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflectingprimarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.The sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoingshift to mobile, which carries higher TAC partially offset by the growth in TAC-free sitesrevenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q3, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year,primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.Google operating income was $10.9 billion, up 14% versus last year and the operatingmargin was 26.9%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, reflectinginvestments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers. Investments in officehttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single8/21\\x0c12/11/2019facilities included the $1 billion acquisition of a portfolio of buildings in Sunnyvale, and thepurchase of two buildings to expand our presence in the Seattle area.Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaMoving on to the performance of Other Bets. Revenues were $155 million, primarilygenerated by Fiber and Verily. Other Bets had an operating loss of $941 million. I'll note acouple of key accomplishments in Other Bets. At Waymo, we're extending fully driverlessopportunities on a small scale to participants in our early rider program in Metro Phoenix.We're also testing long-haul truck driving on Arizona freeways. And we're continuing totest Waymo vehicles in various geographies, the newest of which is heavy rain testing insouthern Florida. In addition, we have begun 3D mapping in Los Angeles.And two weeks ago, Wing launched its first commercial drone delivery service to homes inVirginia in partnership with FedEx, Walgreens, and local Virginia retailer Sugar Magnolia.Wing is now operating on three continents in early test deliveries.I will sum up with a few observations on the quarter and our longer term outlook. Based onthe strength of the U.S. dollar today relative to the fourth quarter of last year, we expectcontinued FX headwinds again in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, foreignexchange headwinds affect both revenues and operating income, given the majority of ourexpenses are in the U.S.With respect to revenues, we're pleased with the performance of our advertising business.As a reminder, there is variability in year-over-year revenue growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. As we’ve often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on aquarterly basis, and we remain very-focused on continuing to enhance the experience forusers and advertisers over the long term. Within other revenues, in addition to continuedstrength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics ascustomers are seeing the benefits from implementing BigQuery. Cloud continued to seesignificant growth in each region globally.Our new lineup of Made by Google hardware was announced two weeks ago with pixel 4hitting store shelf late last week. With the introduction of the Pixel 3a in the secondquarter, we expect the seasonality of our hardware business to be moderated somewhat.Turning to elements of our profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses. Whileheadcount growth on an absolute basis in the third quarter was usually high, reflecting theaddition of new college hires, we do remain on pace for headcount growth in 2019 to be inline with growth in 2018. Our investments in talent support innovation across ourbusinesses and in particular support our ongoing momentum in cloud.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single9/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019Regarding sales and marketing expenses, as I’ve mentioned on prior calls, theseexpenses are typically more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year and tend tobe particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. In Other Bets,we continue to invest meaningfully and thoughtfully for the long-term opportunities that wesee.Turning to capital allocation and CapEx. With respect to capital returns, consistent withannouncing an increase in our stock buyback authorization last quarter to $25 billion, wewere pleased to step up repurchase levels by nearly 60% to $5.7 billion in the thirdquarter. In terms of CapEx, as a reminder, over the last couple of years, the split betweentechnical infrastructure and office facilities has averaged approximately 70% to 30%. Dueto the sizable purchases of office facilities we made in Q3, technical infrastructureaccounted for only about 60% of total CapEx and continued to be more heavily weightedto data center construction and servers.Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of CapEx investment will continue to beour expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machinelearning across our business as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube. At this scale ofinvestment, we remain very-focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization andtight management of our supply chain.In conclusion, we remain confident about the opportunities ahead. Sundar and I will nowtake your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Yourline is now open.Eric SheridanThanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, Sundar, big picture question. Itfeels like the concept of the ambient computing was sort of prevalent at the Made byGoogle event recently. It started with sort of a bit of a shift in theme, what I could tell atGoogle I/O earlier this year. Can you just talk about what some of the key investments youwant to make to capitalize on that opportunity into long-term? How you think Google andmaybe broader Alphabet is positioned to capitalize on that? How it might show up at theproduct services layer? So, I guess, maybe a three-part question, more of a bigger picturenature.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single10/21\\x0c12/11/2019Sundar PichaiAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaThanks, Eric. We are very excited by the vision of ambient computing and evolving that. Ithink, it's a continuity in the sense that over time computing should be more intuitive tousers and computing should adapt to users, not the other way around. And thefoundations of all of this is all the work we have done with our computing platforms till dateand under successful consumer services and developer platforms we have built. And Ithink that's the most of the investments there. The phones will continue to be at the centerof ambient computing for the future. So, that's another important piece where we arealready invested in.I think, as we expand beyond and that's what the Made by Google family is focused on,products in your home with our Nest family of products, and wearables which we do withWear OS and so on. So, supporting that ecosystem, so whether you're at home or on thego or at work, and making sure it works.Our investments in the AI across the Company, I think, will end up playing a key role, AIand Assistant. I think, they'll be at the center of making sure we can anticipate what userswant and serve them better.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.Doug AnmuthSundar, you talked about the new neural network techniques talking about the biggestbreakthrough in Search in years. Could you just help us understand if that’s impacting kindof the advertising and monetization side of the business yet or how that can play out goingforward?Sundar PichaiAnytime -- maybe I’ll answer it, as BERT, which is the name of the technique we're using,and we’ve rolled it out in Search now. And obviously, anytime we can better make senseof queries, we can serve users better, our search quality goes up, and people engage andthat’s -- engage more. So, it's part of a long run sort of things we've been working on, butthis is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experienceand search quality. And remember, it will help us in a certain set of queries. There aremany queries which we’re already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and helphttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single11/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019understand human context better. And so, I would just characterize this as a bigimprovement, which improves search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by whichpeople engage more.Of course, a lot of times, we take the same techniques, and sometimes it makes sense onthe app side, and down the line, machine learning techniques. And we'll deploy it there aswell.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.Heather BelliniI just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about Cloud, Sundar. Iwas wondering if you could just give us some color on the size of your GCP backlog. Andmaybe even if you just talk about the trajectory, and how that's changed over the course ofthe last year? And then, you mentioned the strength and the uptake of BigQuery, I'm justtrying to think through how we should think of the margin, level of a service like this versusthe traditional compute offerings where you've seen strength to date. And just wondering,if we start to see some positive mix shifts benefits, as some of these premium productsstart to start to ramp more aggressively? Thank you.Sundar PichaiThanks, Heather. Overall, I know, we gave some visibility into our cloud business and we'llcontinue to do that periodically. And the momentum has been great. Obviously, ever sinceThomas has come in, he has continued to invest across the board. He’s definitely focuseda lot on scaling up our sales partner and operational teams. And, it's playing out well. Inthis business, it's important for you to be in as many deal situations as possible and getthose wins, which accrues over time. And so, we are definitely seeing the momentum.Analytics is a huge area of strength for us. And it's an area, which Thomas has a lot ofexpertise in as well. And BigQuery is such a strong product, so it's a natural area, we areseeing strength. And my sense is, as we get -- if I look at the TAM, the percentage of TAMfor which we were eligible, compared to two years ago to last year to now, that number isshifting aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or be completingsome of the certifications we need. And so, I think, there are several strong forward-looking indicators and look forward to sharing more at the right time.Operatorhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single12/21\\x0c12/11/2019And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line isnow open.Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaMark MahaneyCan I just ask you to draw a little bit more out on Google Maps? I know that’s formarketing earlier in the year that that seems like that's now at a stage where it's going tobe better integrated into the -- I don't know, the purchase path or whatever, you're makingit easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads. Justtalk about the pace at which that -- the monetization of that or just the ad opportunities willbe offered to small businesses? Thank you.Sundar PichaiIn general, local is an important area for us, and we are continuing to invest in buildingexperience that connects merchants, advertisers and users. Google My Business hasbeen our major effort there. Today millions of businesses are -- reach and engage, boththrough Search and Maps. Specifically, in GML, we announced that we’ll expand localcampaigns. I presume that's what you're talking about. It's still early. And in general, wewant to make it easier for advertisers, particularly SMBs to come to Google and be able toreach users across our set of owned and operated properties. So, be it Search, be itYouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps, and that's the way we envision that. But, small andmedium business is a big area of focus and maps represents a big, long-term opportunityfor us.Ruth PoratAnd just to add on there, given you referenced back to GML, and I think we talked aboutthis last quarter as well. Our view is that the products that were introduced to GML, thisyear, like in previous years, they're rolled out in phases, they're adopted over time. Andso, we don't view the potential impact from this year's slate differently than the impact fromproducts that were launched at previous events, and so just to kind of keep that inperspective.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is nowopen.Lloyd Walmsleyhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single13/21\\x0c12/11/2019Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaI wanted to ask another one about new product you guys announced earlier this year atGML. And that was really Google Shopping and moving that across some of the newdifferent properties like YouTube and Image Search and Discover. Can you give us asense for where you are in that migration, kind of over what timeframe should we bethinking about that? And then, maybe just elaborate a bit on the long-term vision ofmoving shopping functionality into properties like YouTube and how you think thatexperience will evolve? Thanks.Sundar PichaiIn general, I think it’s paid opportunity for us. We see tons of what I would call commercialuser journeys across Google. Obviously Search is an important area, Image Search,YouTube, Maps all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees ofcommercial interest, looking to discover and at times transact as well. So, we’ve startedthinking much more holistically about what are those experiences and how can we make itbetter. That involves helping improve the Discovery experience, but when people areinterested in it, being able to make it easier to transact. So, the equivalent of being signedand being able to pay when you want and then of course the fulfillment and logistics. So,we're thinking through the end to end experience across all our surfaces and areinvesting. But, I see the user interest, and it’s an area that I think we have significantopportunities ahead.Ruth PoratAnd again, these are still earlier stage and it’s -- we’re excited about the longer termimpact. But, just again make it clear we’re just still in the earlier stages of testing.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Yourline is now open.Brian NowakThanks for taking my questions. I have two. Ruth, I think you mentioned the DesktopSearch might have been one of the contributors of growth. Can you just talk to us little bitabout what types of products or verticals you’re still seeing growth? I know desktop searchreally impressive, given how long has this been around. And then, Sundar, with all theexciting changes going on with search become more relevant et cetera. Can you just talkabout some of the KPIs that you monitor or what you're seeing when it comes to queryhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single14/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019volumes, click through rate, overall response time, what are you seeing that sort of givesyou confidence that you’ll continue to get more and more relevant results for your users?Thanks.Ruth PoratSo, in terms of desktop, I described it as a solid contributor to revenue growth. And whatwe see is that desktop does remain an important form factor for certain more complextasks. So, things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options, what we see isusers continue to go back to desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. And Ithink one of the things that we’ve been very focused on is that innovations that benefitmobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.Sundar PichaiAnd then, in terms of -- obviously, we’ve been -- over time, we've developed verycomprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search -- search quality -- to get asense of such quality and how user satisfaction is through search. But, to give you asense of -- we continue to take that work deeper, we realize users sometimes do searchesthrough sessions understanding what is their satisfaction across the session, what is theirengagement, are they getting at what they are looking for? Those are all some of thedeeper work we are undertaking, and also understanding by vertical how we are helpingusers. There was an earlier question around shopping and commerce. That's an exampleof the kind of vertical and what can we do to make that experience better. Health isanother vertical in which we have a whole Google Health team focused on understandingthe in-depth experience that would give better experience overall in search. So, verycomprehensive effort and we are constantly looking to do it deeper and broader at thesame time.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open.Colin SebastianI have two. Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google. But, I'mwondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversight possiblyimpacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time, and ultimately toremain competitive? And second, Sundar or Ruth, we don't often ask about the displaynetwork, but just wondering, given all the concerns around privacy, ad blocking and thelike, how do you view this business strategically, as part of the overall ecosystem?https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single15/21\\x0c12/11/2019Sundar PichaiAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaOn the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that benefit users andsupport the ecosystem. And so, our products and services benefit consumers, small andmedium businesses, advertisers, and overall, they help reduce prices and expand choice.And so, that's our underlying approach, I think, which is what helps us engage and explainto regulators and we’ll continue to do that. I think, there are also many new areas ofopportunities available for us, and in many of these areas we are the new entrant and wecreate competition. And sometimes the competitive pressures can lead to concerns fromothers. And so, that's part of what's going on as well. But, the other area is, in addition todeveloped markets, we are investing deeply in our next billion users. So, markets likeAPAC continue to be bit long term opportunities for us as well.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.Ross SandlerRuth, just, if you rewind the clock a little bit, when we entered this year, you had called outhow some product changes may cause year-over-year growth rates to fluctuate from timeto time. And we haven't heard that in a couple of quarters. So, as we look out towards like2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place, as far asSearch and YouTube are concerned, and that these product changes might be a little bitmore subtle going forward, or could we return to having more meaningful impact in thefuture, just any color there? And then, on the third quarter, the Asia region, the growth ratewas solid but a tad lower than the prior trend. So, anything notable to call out on APAC?Ruth PoratSo, in terms of the first question, I think, as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased withthe strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter. And as wesaid, since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results and we'llalways do the right thing for the long term. We're very focused on investing for the longterm. And I tried to make it clear in opening comments that as a result, quarterly growthcan vary and has varied. And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly growtharound the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us underscore thestrength and the vibrancy actually in our business. And that's particularly true at our size,in the last 12 months we've generated over $150 billion in total revenues. That's about $25https://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single16/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019billion of growth in the last year. And we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities.But, I would make the point that we do keep a lens to the long-term. In terms of yourquestion about geographies.When we look at the performance on a fixed FX basis around the globe, pleased with theperformance again in the third quarter. You aptly point out, year-on-year growth in APAC inthe third quarter was a bit lower than the second quarter. That primarily reflected slowergrowth in the network business, and that was in part due to policy changes. It alsoreflected the fact that the launch of the Pixel 3a was in the second quarter, which boostedthe year-on-year growth rate in the second quarter. But, I think also implicit in yourquestion, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed FX basis, running it about now $7 billionin quarterly revenues, we’re really pleased with all what the team is doing and the year-on-year growth rate.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.Dan SalmonSundar, maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on the Discover feed. That's anew product that we featured in the past that I know a lot of users are getting more useout of. You gave us I think some updates on monthly active users or DA use in the past.Any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the totalamounts of usage goes on there, that's obviously been featured to users a little bit more.And then, second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth. Sundar spoke at length about yourinvestments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of theearnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping driveefficiencies across the country -- across the Company and your operating costs overall?Thanks.Sundar PichaiDiscover is the product we are very excited about. I think, it completes the other half ofSearch. Search is, we do our mission for our users and be helpful when they come to uslooking for information, Discover is the other half where we are proactively understandingwhat might be most helpful or relevant to them and getting it to them. And we definitely arefocused on product quality and making sure the product is actually helpful to users, andhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single17/21\\x0c12/11/2019Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alphawhen they engage with it, they find it useful. And it's definitely we are making progress.Our investments and machine learning are helping us well. We are definitely able to betteranticipate and give them information proactively.So, over time, I see it as important area for us. And it's done and close. It's part of oursearch and knowledge efforts. And as we do that, you can imagine, you may have starteda query in Search, and it's a session, maybe you're looking to take a trip somewhere, oryou're researching a particular topic, we may be able to continue that discussion on theuser journey in Discover, and that creates a virtuous cycle. So, these are -- we want to behelpful to users in a way that makes sense for them, more continually, and thecombination of Search and Discover helps us do that.Ruth PoratAnd in terms of your question on sustainability, we're proud of the work that we're doing.We do think that it’s a valuable part of what we do, and we do consider the impact on thebusiness and on the financials. It really cuts across every element of what we do, whatwe’re doing in our technical infrastructure, the way we’re thinking about our products thatSundar talked about, what we're doing with our facilities, what we're doing with AI. And Ithink it was about a year ago we talked about how we were applying machine learning toenergy efficiency in our data centers, and it did have a net benefit. It helped us reduceenergy consumption, not only positive for sustainability but was an efficiency effort.Sundar talked about the fact that we are investing -- recently announced that we arepurchasing, making an equal investment in renewable energy, part of our commitment tooffset 100% of our electricity use with renewable. And in our view this is catalyzing furtherinvestment in renewable. That is going to have a modest short-term increase in cost. But,we think it’s beneficial to catalyzing the overall growth in traditional energy. So, there areputs and takes and that we're proud of the work across everything that we are doing tosupport sustainability.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.Stephen JuSo, Sundar, I was wondering if you can put the quantum computing investment into somesort of perspective. Compute needs for Google have to be exponentially higher versuswhen you first launched. So, we’re wondering if this helps you get your arms around thatever-increasing compute need. And further, I think you’ll find that investors are ashttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single18/21\\x0c12/11/2019Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alphaimpatient as you guys are for progress. So, can you talk about what kind of products orservices this will help you create that you other couldn’t even think about doing before?Thanks.Sundar PichaiI’m incredibly proud of the work that the team did and excited about the advancement inthe whole industry. I think, in general, obviously, we’ve relied on advances in computing tobe able to do what we do. And when we look ahead, we definitely see being able to drivethe pace of change here fastest is an important need for us as well as I think source ofcompetitive advantage. As Moore’s Law effects have diminished, I think, we are looking atvariety of approach to make sure we can continue doing what we need to. And in that thisis an important tool into arsenal. While quantum will take many years to really start makinga difference, we want to be at the cutting edge of driving it. I don’t think over time for sure,cloud itself, we do see a lot of interest from cloud customers, particularly in cutting-edgeverticals about quantum computing. And so, that's an area where I think we’ll participate inas a business, and more importantly applying it across other verticals we are in, be ithealth, as an example, I think we will be where we will deliver value in the long run.Ruth PoratAnd as much as we're extremely excited about the long-term implications for quantumcomputing, part of your question there about our near term computing requirements.Given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand forcompute investments to support our growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud,Search and YouTube. And the primary driver of the CapEx does continue to be ourexpectations for compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, aswe've talked about today.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.Brent ThillThanks. I need a Google headset. Sundar, just on investments in GCP, you're in a reallyunique situation, having built infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walkthrough how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways you can goin GCP. And just want to follow up with Ruth. You alluded to some G Suite pricinghttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single19/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019changes. And I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year. And Iwas just curious if you were referring to that price change or earlier in the year or if therewas something new?Sundar PichaiI mean, you're right. I mean, these are two big buckets and we treat them that way.Obviously, we've talked a lot about GCP, but G Suite continues to be very differentiated.And, we just announced a new leader Javier Soltero coming in with lots of experience toturbo-charge this area as well.And in general, there are many G Suite customers now with who we are having GCPconversations and vice versa. So, I think in general, given we have a big go-to-marketeffort, the breadth you have allows us to have more conversations and engage throughmany different paths into the organization. So, it's very synergistic as well.Ruth PoratAnd in terms of the G Suite pricing, I was referencing the pricing that we announced backin April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was, it was the right time to increaseprices, given the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G Suite. And as Isaid, what we're seeing here is in addition to the benefit from the price change. We alsocontinue to have nice seat growth.OperatorAnd our final question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America MerrillLynch. Your line is now open.Justin PostI think I’ll ask on YouTube, could you talk a little bit about your high level OTT viewingstrategy? Obviously, subscriptions are growing. Maybe give us an update on how yourYouTube subscription product is doing versus expectations? And then, on the paid clickgrowth, it decelerated 18%, anything to call out there, especially related to YouTube, anychange to coverage going on or anything we should know about? Thank you.Sundar PichaiSubscription is an area we are different definitely excited about. We are pleased with ouroptions so far across both, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. They're now availablein 71 countries from five markets at the start of 2018. So, we are definitely scaling that uphttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4299748-alphabet-inc-goog-q3-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single20/21\\x0cAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) Q3 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha12/11/2019and we're seeing great traction. YouTube TV is also doing well. I think, we just announcedthat PBS is coming to YouTube TV in July. Last month, we announced YouTube TV is nowlaunching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So, there's definite -- the user satisfactionon the product is high. And so, we are focused on continuing our expansion, building out agreat service and building awareness for the service. So, overall, I think, engaging userswith premium offerings on YouTube is the focus for us. And the efforts, while early, aredefinitely showing strong traction.Ruth PoratAnd then, you asked about click growth and the trend there, the biggest driver affectingthe click trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement ads. As in the firstand second quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. Thatdoes continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the userand advertiser experience. And as we've talked about on prior calls, that did have animpact on click growth. But as we also talked about, they weren't related to those changesin 2018. We're not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube, they had anegligible impact on YouTube revenues. So, not a read through.OperatorAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn theconference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.Ellen WestThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on ourfourth quarter call. Thank you again and have a good evening.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
